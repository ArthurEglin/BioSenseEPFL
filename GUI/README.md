## Structure
The GUI repository of the 2023 SenSwiss Team is organized as follows:
- `image_saved`: stores the images taken by the camera or the spectrographs taken by the spectrometer during the experiments.
- `layout_figures`: contains the figures used in the GUI
- `plots_saved`: stores the data plots generated by the GUI
- `protocols`: store the protocols used for the experiments, these protocols can be defined and directly loaded in the GUI
- **arduino_control.py**: contains the code to control the Arduino board
- **control_flir_camera.py**: contains the code to control the camera
- **gui.py**: contains the code of the GUI
- **imgproc.py**: contains the main functions to process the images taken by the camera and the spectrographs taken by the spectrometer
- **layout.py**: contains the code to define the layout of the GUI
- **microflu.py**: contains the code to control the microfluidic system

## Installation
To run the code, you will need to install several packages. The easiest way to do so is to use the Anaconda distribution. You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Once Anaconda is installed, you can create a new environment and install the packages using the following commands in the Anaconda prompt:
```
conda create -n senswiss python=3.10
conda activate senswiss
```
Then, you can install the packages using the following commands:
```
pip install name_of_the_library
```

<a id="Description"></a>
## Description
This miniprogram allow the user to control the different systems of the sensor and to perform the experiments. The GUI can be used in two modes: with a camera or with a spectrometer, depending on which measurement is better suited for the experiment. The GUI will then automatically adapt the interface to the chosen mode.

The GUI is divided into 3 parts:
- **Microfluidics** which controls the pump
- **Measurement device** which controls either the camera or the spectrometer depending on which is pluged in, and procresses the signal to obtain a signal over time
- **Motor control** which controls the DC motor to open or close the measurement chamber

## Usage
To run the GUI, you can use the following command in the Anaconda prompt after activating the environment:
```
python gui.py
```
Be sure to check that the necessary devices (camera/spectrometer, pump, arduino) are connected to the computer before running the GUI.

<a id="Results"></a>
## Results
Explain the regression of the results obtained with the GUI to relate to the concentration of proteins in the sample.
