# Software repository of the 2023 SenSwiss Team

The software repository of the 2023 SenSwiss Team is organized as follows:

- `ARDUINO`: contains the commands to communicate with the Arduino board and the DC motors of the biosensor
- `GUI`: this folder allows for the implementation of the graphical user interface (GUI) of the 2023 biosensor. The GUI is implemented in Python and enables the control of the microfluidics, spectrometer and camera settings

It provides an extensive range of customizable settings along with intelligent features. For further details on file organization and their functions, please consult the GUI folder and the READme annexed to it.
